## Introduction

The aim of this repository is to provide a set of small but useful tools, each solving a specific issue or 
simplifying a particular task. While the programs are primarily written in Go and C++, 
the problem-solving techniques and logic can be extrapolated to other programming languages. 
This repository will be continuously updated with new programs as they are created.

## Installation

As the programs are written in Go and C++, make sure you have the Go and C++ compilers installed in your system. 
You can then clone the repository and run the programs locally.

To clone the repository, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Handy-Coding-Toolbox-in-Go-and-CPP.git

## Usage

Each program is self-contained and can be run independently. 
All programs are well-commented, and their respective purposes are documented. 

To run a program, navigate to its respective directory and follow the instructions 
provided in the program's comments or the accompanying README, if any.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! If you have a useful program you'd like to add, or if you have an improvement to an existing program, 
feel free to make a pull request. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
